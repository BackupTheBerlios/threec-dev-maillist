Subject: [Threec-dev] Starting to create the barebones website
Message-ID: <11b871c50510202036r152ff134h92b48f33ee741626@mail.gmail.com>

I started making some progress on the website such as creating users
and being able to log in (not that I have started sessions yet). 
However I need the database schema plus any modifications you think
are necessary for it.  Also I'm going to hold off on making the wiki
section because if we want anything semi-nice for a wiki, the DB for
the wiki pages is going to be a bit complex.

I am leaning toward using Xen rather than User Mode Linux based on the
following link.

I'd actually like to find a similiar discussion about Xen.

Another interesting discussion is here by Dave Harding.

Message-ID: <a5d9c4580510221728p223434b4raebc80d23953b918@mail.gmail.com>

I installed TurboGears with ez_setup.py, and then I run the server with

rob:~/code/trunk/threec$ python threec-start.py

And it seems to start up fine, but then when I visit localhost:8080, I
get the following error message,

500 Internal error

Server got itself in trouble

Subject: [Threec-dev] An experiment that has to do with our project

This person is trying the major web development frameworks for python
and blogging about them.  Haven't read the Cherrpy one but it most
likely doesn't effect me.  Turbogears does a good job glueing the
things together and picked a templating library in Kid that I've found
to be easier to pick up than some others I recently looked at. 
Unfortunately there was no mention in performance for Twisted and I
doubt any mention will be made considering this is an experiment for
being able to pick up the frameworks and their documentation, which
twisted apparently severely lacked a few months back

I see this comes from trunk/threec/dev.cfg.  I think we should really
design the software so we don't have to hardcode things like this, as
it will make it much easier for others to deploy the code.  Is there
someway to make that file get loaded from the users home directory?  I
guess it just involves some hacking of threec-start.py.

The logic should be something like

if found_config_in_home_dir:
   load_from_home_dir
else:
   cp template_from_current_dir to_homedir
   load_from_home_dir

Sessions are going to be incorporated into turbogears directly in the
upcoming patches so I am just going to hold off until then and in the
meantime put together some fake data for submissions and contests to
try and flesh out how SQLObject works.

On the slightly revised database?  I mainly added a submission table. 
As far as having integer IDs for the entries I think SQLObject does
all that behind the scene but will be reading the docs more thoroughly
soon.  AlternateID lets me grab a record directly via a function call
to that field, i think it makes another table that maps the name to
the ID or I could just be making all of this up.  Also feel free to
add in useful function APIs to navigate the database to get anything
we want from anything it's related to.  This should be pretty easy
once I (if ever) learn databases.

I looked a little bit at the docs for SQLObject.  I pulled them down
onto my laptop too.  It looks pretty cool.  It seems like it makes DB
interaction a breeze.

Learned a little bit and changed the database around, this look
alright?  Do I have all the information there?
