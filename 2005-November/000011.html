<PRE>So Jimmy wants to make a new contest and he creates the barebones part
of it, the name start and endtimes.  Now Jimmy is going to submit his
zip file of the problems as well as a zip of the private portion of
the problems (I/O to run programs on, time/memory limits etc) to the
system and days and nights go by and all of a sudden its time for the
contest to start.  The machine unzips the problems and via a nice XML
script adds to the database the core properties of each problem as
well as adding the problem statements to a url so people can view via
the web.

So instead of trying to explain the problem outright I gave a possible
solution.  The problem is about the whole how do we let people make
contests and add problems to their contest while at the same time
keeping the problems and more importantly their input and output
secret to the system hopefully implying secret to users.  So yea my
idea is some downloadable application that allows contest hosters to
enter problem data on their own computer and it will zip/form this
script/password the file until the contest is about to begin.

What I don't like about this is how hefty this can be.  Perhaps
allowing them to upload these things normally and leaving the items
hidden isn't really that bad.
