Are you sure you really want the contents to be kept secret from the
database?  It seems like the contest would be an all our nothing,
throw a shitload of code over the wall and hope it doesn't hit the fan
kind of deal.  How is the contest creator going to know that for
example, his judging programs will run on our system?  How is he going
to tune time limits to the judge without actually testing them on the
judge?

Do you think we gain that much secrecy by not hosting their not yet
public data?  Is it just that the admins of the box cannot be trusted
with a not yet released contest data lying around where we can peek at
it?  What if we store the contest data encrypted, and give the contest
host the option (maybe require it) of keeping the key on her system. 
Then when she wants to edit the contest, she provides the key during
her session, which we intentionally keep only as long as the session
is running.

I agree that I don't think we should do much client side development,
and for the client side stuff, try to make it as portable and small as
is reasonable.
