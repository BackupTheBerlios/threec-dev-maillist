<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>This was ripped from the wikipedia page at Rob's request in an effort
to organize what information goes where so please ignore the
references to prior paragraphs.

Switching gears (which will probably at some point warrant its own
wikipage), I'll start discussing the issues presented that affect the
product from the users perspective.  But first a more specific look at
the goals of the entire project.  First and foremost, we want C^3 (or
ThreeC) to run out of the box.  One or two simple, conveniently placed
command line arguments to start the webserver (and the judger in the
secure competition mode, and maybe a database too, I don't know all
that much about them).  Everything related to the actual contest
hosting will be modified via a web interface.  That in itself is a
huge UI issue but before we get into that, I want to stay general and
talk about who runs contests and how to run contests.

The question as to who runs contests probably has different answers
depending on who you ask.  If you ask myself or Rob, it means anyone
that wants to can do so and that person can do so publically or
privately.  We do intend on running this application for the rest of
the web, and letting others host contests as they please with our
servers.  Clearly there are security issues, that's Rob's job.

If you ask someone else the question of who runs contests on their
server the answer may (justifiably) be, only they do.  If this is the
case it should be easy to choose who can and cannot host contests,
participate in contests and the like.

We want this software to be used in academic instituions (read
Colleges/Universities/High Schools/anyplace where students are
learning to code or solve problems or whatever).  Settings should be
able to be saved between sessions.  If someone wants to use this for
weekly local contests, they should be able to upload a tar of the
problemset and solutions or just put them in predetermined
directories, run the startup script and not have to look back.

People without access to the hosting server should be able to use the
web interface to do anything someone with access can do (pertaining to
the contest hosting of course).  This interface should be intuitive,
complete and to put it plainly, kick major ass.  Problems may arise
during the contest where problems or solutions or judging programs may
need to be removed/changed along with statistical changes for teams
that fell victim (or beneficiary) to errors.  The goal of the UI is to
minimize the number of page loads but remain intuitive and
uncluttered.  Those aspects certainly oppose one-another but I guess
this will be a test for our innovation.

Next (still related) Topic - Uploading problemsets.  Selecting a
problem, its input file, output file, and possibly an alternate judger
to upload is tedious.  Doing so 6-8 times is aggravating.  The
solution is to allow tar or zip files to be uploaded which we will
unzip.  Then arises the issue of figuring out which file is for what,
so we have to put some thought into a naming/formatting convention
that contest hosters will do while they put the files together instead
of a timeconsuming afterthought.  Allow for easy manipulation of
problemsets before they go live such as ordering of presentation in
the contest, live editting for typos to remove any need for
re-uploading except in serious cases (an incorrect output is probably
easier to just replace than scrolling through thousands of cases
fixing them by hand).

Active Contest Details - In addition to being able to change
problems/input/output/etc... the ability to easily (automatically?)
fix scores/rejudge problems is certainly on the list of things to do. 
Add a notification message thing would probably be helpful instead of
getting a popup box saying your submission was accepted, a submission
that was marked incorrect an hour ago, on a problem you havent
submitted to in 50 minutes.  I digress.

Getting problems to the competitors - When a contest begins theres a
mad rush to download the problems on UVA/Topcoder.  UVA significantly
slows down, TopCoder actually has a hardcore server and a massive
pipe.  The proposed solution is to allow anyone to download a
passworded tar/zip of the problems ahead of time, and when the contest
starts, the password is posted, crisis averted.  I could have sworn I
stole this idea from somewhere, but apparently Rob thought it was a
good idea and didn't accuse me of ripping it off from elsewhere so
maybe I really am a genius, but I don't think so.

Things for the Competitors - We want to integrate a method of
submitting via emacs.  This will prove difficult with the current
state of cherrpy which basically only allows sessions through cookies.
 Someone else posted on the [<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/turbogears">http://groups.google.com/group/turbogears</A>
Turbogears Google Groups] which no one responded to (well he posted
along with some other questions, people responded to those other
ones).  We will certainly have a web page submission just like UVA,
but I'd really like a nicer way to submit that doesn't involve
searching through directories for a file, or copy/pasting files into a
web form (I'm still paranoid that doing so screws up stuff, especially
in a language like Python that uses whitespace indentation in its
syntax).

Excuse the layout change, on the upcoming concerns.

Allow for distributed webservers that serve copies of the same files
for distributed events.  Also requires a distributed design for
statistical collection and display.

Custom RSS feeds, requires a gmail notifier type thing where the login
and password are displayed as a garbled hex digest from sha, possibly
interweaving the characters also, but that can easily be reverse
engineered if people knew we were using sha.  Or maybe just make it
insecure, paste in the login name as an argument.  Who cares if
someone sees your feeds.  Well if your feed contains sensitive
information such as hosted contests don't post any details about the
&quot;article&quot;, then again that doesn't change without your consent, oh I
don't know....

Let contest hosters supply a list of people that can view/edit
contests they plan on hosting.

Stats
-------
1. Customizable scoring for contests
a. some format for returning number of correct cases vs total cases
and the percentage.
b. can just judge correct or incorrect
c. penalities for incorrect
d. points can be variable for problems - even dynamically variable
(actual values wont be computed until the end of the match)
2. Allow for customizable rating systems.
a. Submission times and number of submissions completely describe a match?
b. some mechanism for seeing when a problem was viewed?  can't use the
zip/password method obviously.  Very open to cheating.
c. what stats should the program automatically calculate and provide? 
Intend to allow for tedious common tasks to be done by us, but don't
calculate things that people don't use.  They just add clutter and
make it difficult to find what is wanted. - Thinking total number of
submissions/correct submissions.  Total correctness, averages medians
standard deviations.... ??

Configuration cleanness
--------
No (mandatory) config files!!!!
All settings should be web accessable and modifyable by admin users.
For example forcing contest hosters to only allow securely judged contests.
